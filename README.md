## Overview

This C++ project demonstrates a Windows service that starts at system startup and injects a DLL shellcode into a random process using manual mapping. The project allows users to inject custom shellcode into running processes without leaving traces on the disk, making it an effective way to achieve stealthy code execution.
**Disclaimer:**This project is intended for educational purposes only. Unauthorized DLL injection may violate the terms of service of certain applications and can lead to legal consequences. Use this project responsibly and only on systems you own or have explicit permission to access. See below for ethical use cases.

## Ethical Uses

While DLL injection can be misused, there are ethical and legitimate use cases for this project, including:

- Parental Control Apps: Parental control applications could use this technique to restrict access to certain applications or websites for child safety
- Antivirus Software: Some security applications may use DLL injection to monitor and protect other processes from potential threats
- System Monitoring Tools: Certain system monitoring applications may utilize this project to gather data from running processes at system startup
- Accessibility Tools: Accessibility tools could use this project to modify the behavior of specific applications to better suit the needs of users with disabilities
- Software Licensing and DRM: Some applications may use this project to enforce software licensing or digital rights management (DRM) measures to prevent unauthorized usage
- Security Research: Security researchers may use this technique for studying and analyzing the behavior of malware or suspicious software in a controlled environment

## Features

- Windows service that starts at system startup
- Manual mapping technique for injecting a DLL shellcode into a random process
- Stealthy execution

## Customizing Shellcode

- Open the payload.cpp file in the source code
- Modify the payload array with your custom shellcode. Make sure it's compatible with the target process architecture
- Rebuild the solution in Release mode

## How it Works

The project uses the Windows Service Control Manager (SCM) to create and manage the service. Upon system startup, the service is launched, and it triggers the manual mapping DLL injection technique to inject the custom shellcode into a randomly selected process. The manual mapping technique is chosen for its stealthiness.
